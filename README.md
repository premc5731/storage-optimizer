> A powerful Python script that detects and removes duplicate files in a directory using checksum logic and emails a detailed log report to the specified recipient — fully automated on a scheduled basis.

---

## Features

- ✅ Recursively scans directories and subdirectories
- ✅ Detects duplicate files using **MD5 checksum**
- ✅ Deletes duplicate files automatically
- ✅ Generates a structured log file of deleted files
- ✅ Sends the log via **email (Gmail SMTP)**
- ✅ Supports scheduling with `schedule` module

---

## Technologies Used

- `os` – File and directory operations  
- `hashlib` – MD5 checksum for duplicate detection  
- `smtplib`, `email.mime` – Sending email with attachments  
- `schedule` – Periodic task execution  
- `sys`, `time` – System and time handling

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/duplicate-file-cleaner.git
cd duplicate-file-cleaner
pip install schedule
```

---

## Usage

Run the script from the command line:

```bash
python delete_duplicates_with_email_log.py <DirectoryPath> <TimeIntervalInMinutes> <RecipientEmail>
```

### Example:

```bash
python delete_duplicates_with_email_log.py "C:\Users\prem\Documents" 30 receiver@example.com
```

This will:
- Scan the given directory every 30 minutes
- Remove duplicate files
- Create a log file
- Email the log to `receiver@example.com`

## Log File Output

The script generates a log like this:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<filepath1> deleted at : <timestamp>
<filepath2> deleted at : <timestamp>

```

## 📧 Email Report Format
